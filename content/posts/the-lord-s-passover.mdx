When the LORD remembered His faithful promise to His people, all He wanted is to fulfill it with the blood sacrifice. He gave Moses an
important instruction that will make the deliverance of Israel possible. The details that the LORD gave to Moses points to the details of how Jesus lived
and die according to God’s appointed times (MOEDIM), which He planned to do before the foundation of the world.

## The choosing of the Passover lamb

> Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.
>
> Exodus 12:3 NIV

The LORD said “On the
tenth day,” of this
month each man is to
take a lamb for his
family, one for each
household. Let us see the Lord Jesus
Christ in the shadows
and the substance of
the Scriptures.

Tenth, or ten is the number
for righteousness. And
Jesus declared His “tenth
day” when He asked John
to baptized Him, and later,
the Father declared Him
as “pleasing” to Him for
Jesus was a lamb without
blemish.

> But Jesus answered
> him, "Let it be so now,
> for thus it is fitting for us
> to fulfill all
> righteousness." Then he
> consented.
>
> Matthew 3:15 ESV

The last step in the law
before a high priest
enter the holy place is
the ceremonial washing
by means of the water
in the laver. The high priest washes his body
before entering the holy place.

Jesus fulfilled that Levitical
law of ceremonial washing
when John baptized Him
before He enter the earthly
ministry which is the picture
of the holy place.

> Tell the whole
> community of Israel that
> on the tenth day of this
> month each man is to
> take a lamb for his
> family, one for each
> household.
>
> Exodus 12:3 NIV

Each man or father who
will choose a lamb
without blemish for his
family is the picture of
the heavenly Father
who declared His Son as
pleasing to Him.

> The animals you choose
> must be year-old males
> without defect, and you
> may take them from the
> sheep or the goats.
>
> Exodus 12:5 NIV

The male lamb without
defect, that is pleasing to
the LORD as perfect
offering is the shadow of
the Jesus.

> And behold, a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, **with whom I am well pleased**."
>
> Matthew 3:17 ESV

Our heavenly Father said
about Jesus, “with whom I
am well pleased.” That
means, Jesus was
proclaimed as a pleasing
sacrifice to God.

## The Separation of the Passover Lamb

The chosen lamb must be
kept from the 10th day up
to the 14th day of the
month before being killed
as the Passover lamb.

> Take care of them until the **fourteenth day** of the month, when all the people of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.
>
> Exodus 12:6 NIV

The in between from the
10th day to the 14th day of
their first month is three
days. That is the picture of Jesus
being kept, separated or
sanctified by the Father for
the earthly ministry in three
and a half years. In the Old Testament, after
a priest and a high priest
performed the ceremonial
washing from the laver,
they were permitted to
enter the holy place to
perform their ministry.

Jesus, after being
baptized and declared
pleasing to the Father
has entered into His
earthly ministry which is
the purpose of His
separation. He became the light of
the world to those who
sits in darkness (Menorah),
the bread of life for the
dying souls (show bread),
and the Sabbath to give
rest for the weary souls,
(Altar of incense).

## The Passover

> "Then they shall take
> some of the blood
> and put it on the two
> doorposts and the
> lintel of the houses in
> which they eat it.”
>
> Exodus 12:7 ESV

![the Passover](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxo593xsn/image/upload/v1706499233/gcc-website-content/Screenshot_2024-01-29_at_11.32.49_AM_wbhtjo.webp)

What is the blood that
was applied on the
door posts and lintel?

Passover is very dear to
God’s heart, that He wants
His people to observe it as
an important feast that
must be celebrated every
year.

> The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.
>
> Exodus 12:13 NIV

The word “sign” is
covenant, and the Lord is
saying to the Israelites, “The
blood will be My covenant
for you, that when I see the
blood, I will pass over you.”. God will not violate His own
covenant for it is against His
righteous judgment. When He sees the blood, He
sees that our sins were
already judged, and His
justice was served, which is
the very essence of
atonement. That is why He
will pass over them and the
first born male is exempted. The blood was given by God
to speak in our defense. That is
why the LORD said, “When I
see the blood covenant, No
destructive plague will touch
you when I strike Egypt.

> My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an **advocate** with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
>
> 1 John 2:1 ESV

The duty of an advocate is
to defend his client, and to
win his or her case. The job description of the
Lord Jesus Christ from the
Father is to save His people
from their sins. Meaning, He
will defend the accused. We are the accused, and
how Jesus defend our case
was by satisfying the justice
of God against us through
His bloody death.

> My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
>
> 1 John 2:1 ESV

Jesus Christ the righteous is the advocate who speaks to the Father in our defense. The spotless blood of Jesus
speaks to the Father in our defense.

> To Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
>
> Hebrews 12:24 ESV

The blood of Abel of speaks
justice for his death,
because he was murdered
by his brother Cain.

But the blood of Jesus is
what served the justice of
God, and that same
blood declared us justified
by faith in Him.

> Since we have now been
> justified by his blood, how
> much more shall we be
> saved from God's wrath through him!
>
> Romans 5:9 NIV

The sprinkled blood of Jesus
is what speaks better word
in our defense that is why
the LORD said to Moses,
“When I see the blood, I will
pass over you, and no
destructive plague shall
touch you.” Because it’s the
blood that justified them.

The blood of Jesus speaks better things for us. When the LORD sees His own
blood upon us, He sees us as
righteous, holy, redeemed,
sons of God, citizens of
heaven, royal priests, future
kings and lords, better His
blood speaks betters things
than the blood of Abel.

## The LORD's Passover

> This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD's Passover.
>
> Exodus 12:11 NIV

God said, it is the LORD's
Passover. And that means
two things.

1. He Himself is the picture of the Passover lamb.
2. Since it is the LORD’s Passover, it is His own decision to choose the recipient of salvation.

He chose us in Him to receive eternal salvation.

> For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in His sight...
>
> Ephesians 1:4 NIV

> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace
>
> Ephesians 1:7 NIV

## The Battle in the Mind

> Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.
>
> Revelation 12:10 NIV

Satan is the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them
before our God day and night. The title “satan” in Hebrew
means “the accuser.”
And he function by
bringing charges against
us in the court of God to
plead us guilty. But how do the
saints wins and
make the devil a
looser?

> **They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony**; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
>
> Revelation 12:11 NIV

Satan always speaks bad
against us, but the blood
of Jesus always speak
better things about us.
While the devil is accusing
us, the blood always
plead our forgiveness
saying "Not Guilty!" When the devil speak
against us, the LORD will
say, “When I see the
blood, I will pass over
you.”

> Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
>
> Romans 8:33 ESV

Passover was designed for the
elect only, and Satan cannot
accuse us because it is the
LORD’s Passover for us who He
has chosen, that is why the
saints always overcome him by
the blood of Jesus.
